[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5c5270e1-d609-4a19-9798-43c634a951e2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ethanswan/deploys)

My personal website. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Running Locally

Running `hugo serve` will build the site, serve it on `http://localhost:1313`, and perform automatic rebuilds as you update files.

Running just `hugo` will build the site and store its output in the `public` directory.
