My personal website. Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Beautiful Jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

Test locally with docker by cding into the repo and running:
```
docker run -p 8080:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```

The site will then be available at `localhost:8080` in your browser.
