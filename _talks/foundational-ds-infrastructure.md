I spoke with 84.51˚ teammates Brad Boehmke and Gus Powers at PyData 2021, about what it takes to build internal tooling that effectively enables a large department of data scientists.
The talk is fairly high-level and doesn't require too much technical background.

The video will eventually be posted on YouTube, and at that point I'll link it here; in the meantime, you can look through the slides below.
