Below I've listed my favorite content on the internet.
I also use my second twitter account, [@content_ious](https://twitter.com/content_ious), to tweet things that I found particularly compelling.

# Software Engineering and Data Science

**[Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com)** (Newsletter)
-- The best programming newsletter I read by a wide margin.
Usually has a few articles worth reading and a list of notable open source projects.
For a power Python user, very worthwhile.

# Finance, Business, and Venture Capital

**[Benedict Evans' Newsletter](https://www.ben-evans.com/)** (Newsletter)
-- Benedict Evans, formerly of VC firm Andreesen Horowitz, summarizes what's happened in the tech industry that week and includes some of his own analysis.

**[Money Stuff](http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup)** (Newsletter)
-- Finance isn't my field, but even for a casual reader, this newsletter is sometimes hard to put down.
The author hits a few relevant news items of the day and explains them, often finding the humor in a field that can seem as dry as it gets.

**[Stratechery](https://stratechery.com)** (Newsletter/Podcast)
-- Business strategy analysis, usually focusing on one of the big players in tech each week and some recent news about them.
It seems targed at tech executives who want to understand the economics and strategy of the industry.

# Policy and Economics

**[Slow Boring](https://www.slowboring.com)** (Newsletter)
-- Even though this newsletter comes daily, its topics are only sometimes topical.
The author (Matt Yglesias) sends his analysis and opinions on whatever topic is on his mind.
He manages to almost always have interesting takes without being provocative for its own sake.

**[The Weeds](https://www.vox.com/the-weeds)** (Podcast)
-- A policy-focused discussion show with a significant, albeit explicit, liberal leaning.
I find its best quality to be that the hosts often engage with the counterarguments against their own positions.
Matt Yglesias, of Slow Boring (above), is one of the regulars.

**[EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/)** (Podcast)
-- A podcast that I initially thought too dry has become one of my favorites.
Economist Russ Roberts interviews various guests about their work, which is often in fields outside economics.
Roberts comes at most issues with a strong free market perspective, and occasionally disagrees with his guests, but is always quick to point out that he could be wrong.

# NBA

**[Dunc'd On](http://nateduncannba.com)** (Podcast)
-- Probably the most hardcore NBA-nerd content on the internet.
The hosts produce roughly five hours of podcasts a week, going deep on both game analysis and salary cap minutae.
Not for the faint of heart, but analytically-minded basketball fans will find its level of breadth to be unique.

**[Thinking Basketball](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thinking-basketball/id1428290303)** (Podcast)
-- Where Dunc'd On focuses on incredible breadth, Thinking Basketball takes a totally opposite approach.
The best episodes are the ones in which the host goes very deep on a specific topic (e.g. what is "basketball IQ" and how do we assess it?).
