I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based software developer and teacher.

I currently work at <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com">ReviewTrackers</a> as a full stack engineer.
I also teach Python, both freelance and through the University of Cincinnati, where I'm an adjunct instructor.
You can see what I teach [here](/teaching/courses/), and if you or your organization is interested in a class, please reach out.
I also offer consulting in data science and web development.

For fun, I play basketball and frisbee, read newsletters, dabble in video games, and work on software projects -- some of which I blog about on this site.
As far as tech, I've recently become very interested in the design of programming languages and compilers/interpreters.

I tweet infrequently, but you can find me on twitter [@eswan18](https://twitter.com/eswan18).
