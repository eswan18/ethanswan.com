I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based software developer and teacher.

I currently work as a fullstack engineer at <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com">ReviewTrackers</a>.
I'm also an adjunct instructor at the University of Cincinnati, where I teach workshops and courses on Python's applications in data science.
You can see what I teach, along with descriptions and the date of next delivery, [here](/teaching/courses/).

Beyond my formal work, I offer private [office hours](/teaching/office_hours/) to help with various development and data science workflows and do some freelance technology consulting as well.
If you're interested in these services, please reach out to me by email at [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com).

In my free time, I consume more podcasts and newsletters than I really have time for, and keep track of my favorites [here](/content/).
I even make [a podcast of my own](https://premature-optimization.pinecast.co).
Occasionally I dabble in [personal coding projects](https://github.com/eswan18) and [blog](/blog) about some of them on this site.
