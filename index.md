I'm a Chicago-based data scientist, technology specialist, and teacher.

Most of my time is spent at <a href="http://www.8451.com">84.51Ëš</a>, the marketing analytics agency of Kroger.
There, as a member of the Advanced Programming and Technology Solutions team, I build internal packages and other tech tools to enable other data scientists to work faster and more efficiently.

I'm also an adjunct instructor at the University of Cincinnati, where I teach workshops and courses on Python's applications in data science.
You can see all the offerings, along with descriptions and the date of next delivery, [here](/courses/).

Beyond my formal work, I offer private [office hours](/office_hours/) to help with data science tools and do some freelance data science consulting.
If you're interested in these services, please reach out to me by email at [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com).

In my free time, I consume myriad podcasts and newsletters, and keep track of my favorites [here](/content/).
I even make [a podcast of my own](https://premature-optimization.pinecast.co).
Occasionally I dabble in [personal coding projects](https://github.com/eswan18) as well, and I [blog](/blog) about some of those projects.
