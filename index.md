I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based software developer and teacher.

I currently work at <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com">ReviewTrackers</a>.
I'm also an adjunct instructor at the University of Cincinnati, where I teach workshops and courses on Python's applications in data science.
You can see what I teach, along with descriptions and the date of next delivery, [here](/teaching/courses/).
I also do some freelance consulting in data science and web development.

For fun, I play basketball and frisbee, read newsletters, dabble in video games, and work on software projects -- some of which I blog about on this site.

I tweet infrequently, but you can find me on twitter [@eswan18](https://twitter.com/eswan18).
I also use my second account, [@content_ious](https://twitter.com/content_ious), to share articles and podcasts that I found especially worthwhile.
