I offer private “technology office hours” to help with topics such as Python, Linux, Git, and other tech that comes up in the data science workflow.
These sessions are held over video call, and you may bring specific questions (including code that you need help with) or general topics you’d like me to explain and discuss.

My rate is $100 an hour, billed in 30-minute chunks.
For new clients, the first 30 minutes are free.
You decide whether the help is valuable enough to continue.
To schedule a session, contact me by email: [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com)

Below are some areas where I can offer guidance.
I may be able to cover topics beyond this list, but be sure to inquire first.

- Python
  - Python itself: core features, tips & tricks, deep internals
  - Data science libraries: Pandas, Numpy, etc.
  - Basic web development
  - Package development and deployment
