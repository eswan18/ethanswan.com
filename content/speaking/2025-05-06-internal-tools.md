Small, early-stage technical organizations focus almost exclusively on their product.
Then as headcount grows, smart companies invest more internally, especially in developing internal tools.

But without a clear vision and strategy, these investments can become confusing, buggy, and poorly-documented, ultimately creating new hurdles for developers and data scientists.

Getting the efficiency gains without falling into these traps is hard, but more than worth the effort. Drawing from my experience building internal tools at various companies – from a growth-stage startup to a very mature bank – I discussed the different strategies I've seen succeed and fail.
