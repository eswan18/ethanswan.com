I run a lot, both when I'm home in Chicago and when I travel.

Running is dull and repetitive by nature, so I do my best to find new routes.
Most of my time is spent in major cities, so I'm also looking for paths with minimal interruptions (i.e. intersections where you have to pause and wait).

I log my adventures here, with a brief description and sometimes photos too.
If you're in a city and looking for a route, you might find them useful.
