I ran from my Airbnb in Capitol Hill up to the Washington Park Arboretum.
Getting there was about 1.5 miles, the Arboretum itself was a bit under 3, and the winding return route I took (to make my way through Interlaken Park) accounted for the remaining 3.5 or so.

This was my favorite run in a while, partly because of the weather but also because of how quiet it was[^quiet].
The Arboretum trail wasn't crowded, and the run through Interlaken Park was almost surreal.
The main trail/road through the park is on a ridge, so you get great views and also run by some very expensive houses.
Over a couple of miles, I didn't see a single car and only two other runners.

The elevation changes in this run were significant.
Getting to the Arboretum took me through a neighborhood with very steep downhills.
Things got reasonably flat for the next several miles, but on the return from Interlaken Park I had to make up most of the elevation
It's a very gradual climb over a mile or so but a more difficult way to finish a run.

[^quiet]: I did this mid-morning on a Tuesday, which contributed to the lack of traffic.
