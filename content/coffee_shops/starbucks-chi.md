Ever reliable, my new Starbucks in Little Italy serves a huge variety of coffee drinks of consistent if unimpressive quality.
Mobile order is more helpful than ever now that I go to coffee shops just to get a drink and leave.
However, my coffee standards have increased over the years and Starbucks' drip coffees are at the very bottom of the *worth drinking* range for me.
