I learned about Ground Up via Foursquare, an app I've found to be a decent indicator of where I can find good coffee.
However, my disappointment was enormous upon purchasing and tasting my first beverage, an iced latte.
The coffee flavors were a rare combination of weak and burned.

Not to rush to judgments, I returned a week later and ordered another.
Turns out that rushing wouldn't have been so bad.

Still, the place is interesting, clean, and well-lit; one can walk in with a few dollars and leave with a latte.
That's a 3.
