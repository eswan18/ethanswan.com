The Rookwood #starbs will efficiently serve you some moderately burned or bitter coffee for a nominal fee, then provide you with mediocre internet.
On the plus side, the place is impossibly clean and hours are excellent -- Starbucks crushes the competition in this regard, staying open until 10:30 on weeknights and 11:30 on weekends.
I have to emphasize the importance of having great hours like this -- there really isn't anywhere else to go if you intend to be working late.
This feature alone makes Starbucks one of the best options around.

But overcrowding sometimes pushes you to less-than-ideal locations, and good luck in the inevitable passive-aggressive staring contest with the guy next to you who also needs to use that one power outlet.
