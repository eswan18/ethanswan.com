Formerly known as Kidd Coffee, Hyde Perk is less than 3 minutes by foot from my apartment, so I feel obligated to walk there.
I donâ€™t really like walking, so thatâ€™s a bit of a drawback.
<br><br>
I find the ambience and chair comfort to be HPâ€™s strong suits.
On the other hand, itâ€™s too expensive and I am a little worried that the new name is intended to pay homage to *Friends* (Central Perk), arguably the worst TV show I have consumed in entirety.
And by far the worst thing about the place is its live music.
Perhaps I find myself in the minority here, but there are few things in life I dread like being in a cafÃ© when a musician hijacks the place.
On three separate occasions, I have been cornered at Hyde Perk and subjected to a performance.
I've reluctantly removed my earphones, resigned myself to getting no work done, and begun searching for discreet escape routes.

If Hyde Perk is reincarnated as [CafÃ© Nervosa](http://thecheersfrasier.wikia.com/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_Nervosa) and cuts the live music nonsense, it can expect a better rating next time.
