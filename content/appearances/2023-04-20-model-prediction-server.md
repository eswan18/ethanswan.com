This is a 3-hour tutorial during which we start with a trained scikit-learn model and incrementally build a working FastAPI application to deliver its predictions in realtime.
It's targeted at data scientists, and no prior experience with API development is expected.
The recording is not yet posted but I will add a link below when that changes.
