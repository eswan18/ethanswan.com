I was a guest on the [Python Bytes Podcast](https://pythonbytes.fm) to join in the week's roundup of news in the Python world.
We talked about [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop), [requests-cache](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/), and [a new PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) in the works to simplify the typing of decorators.
