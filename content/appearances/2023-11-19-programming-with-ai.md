Large language models were the biggest story in tech in 2023.
Many industries are grappling with whether and how LLMs will impact their work in the future, but in the case of data science and software development, useful tools already exist and some practitioners are incorporating them into workflows to great effect.

In this talk, I discussed how LLMs can amplify the practice of writing code in the present, and how the industry might change in response over the coming years.
