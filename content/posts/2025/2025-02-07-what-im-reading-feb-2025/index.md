Since [last year](/feed/2024/01/28/what-im-reading-jan-2024/), my content consumption has changed a little bit.
Not that much though.

If you're just interested in what's changed since last year, here's a summary:

**Removed**: Noahpinion (repetitive, lots of posts, not always insightful), Money Stuff (so many long posts), The Pragmatic Programmer (not that useful imo)

**Added**: Astral Codex Ten (the new MVP of my content consumption), The Intelligence from the Economist (well worth the short episodes), Shardcast: The Brandon Sanderson Podcast (truly useless but I enjoy it, what can I say)

## Newsletters

- [The Morning Briefing](https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-morning-briefing) by The New York Times – General news. I increasingly skim this more than read every word.
- [Slow Boring](https://www.slowboring.com) by Matt Yglesias (paid version) – Political commentary. Left-leaning but pragmatic, empirical, and relatively non-idealogical.
- [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net) by Nate Silver (paid version) – Commentary on political, sports, and other things. This is on the chopping block though: Nate posts a lot about things he doesn't really have anything insightful to say about.
- [Benedict's Newsletter](https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter) by Benedict Evans (free version) – Tech business news and commentary
- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com) by Ben Thompson (free version) – Tech business commentary
- [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com) (free) – News and articles relating to Python (the programming language)
- [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com) by Scott Alexander (paid version, but almost all the content is free) – A very thoughtful blog on all kinds of things, usually focusing on how to allocate resources (our own and the government's) and how to live an effective life.

## Podcasts

- [The Tony Kornheiser Show](http://www.tonykornheisershow.com) – Daily-ish "radio" show about sports and anything else
- [EconTalk](https://simplecast.econtalk.org) – Deep dives on economics topics and sometimes beyond. 2024 was a very bad year for EconTalk, with a lot of Israel/Palestine coverage that I didn't find enlightening along with the regular dose of somewhat-silly topics. But I remain a devoted fan of host Russ Roberts and I'll be sticking with it unless things get worse.
- [Dunc'd On Prime](https://duncdon.supportingcast.fm) – Impossible volumes of NBA talk
- [Freakonomics Radio](https://freakonomics.com/series/freakonomics-radio/) – Discussion of various topics through an economic lens
- [Conversations with Tyler](https://conversationswithtyler.com) – Interviews with unusual people across all kinds of domains
- [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm) – News and discussion about Apple products and occasionally other tech
- [Connected](https://www.relay.fm/connected) – A nonsense show that's nominally about tech
- [Happy Path Programming](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/happy-path-programming/id1531666706) – Thoughtful discussion of programming topics. This might be on the chopping block though, as I like the hardcore programming topics but often the episodes focus on something about people management or social dynamics, where I think the hosts have little to say.
- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) – Productivity & complaining about nothing
- [Plain English with Derek Thompson](https://www.theringer.com/plain-english-with-derek-thompson-podcast) – Deep dives and interviews across various topics
- [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm) – Weekly roundup of Python-related "news"
- [The Ryen Russillo Podcast](https://www.theringer.com/ryen-russillo-podcast) – Sports and "life advice", though I usually skip everything but the life advice.
- [The Intelligence from the Economist](https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-intelligence) – Short episodes (about 25 minutes) that cover a few of the biggest world news items of the day or week
- [Shardcast: the Brandon Sanderson Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/es/podcast/shardcast-the-brandon-sanderson-podcast/id1374695271) – A bunch of dorks talk about the fantasy universe created by Brandon Sanderson. Embarrassing, yes, but I'm a dork too.
