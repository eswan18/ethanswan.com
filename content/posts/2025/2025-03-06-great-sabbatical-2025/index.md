My sabbatical has come to an end, and that means it's time for a retrospective.

I plan to publish some fun[^fun] opinion pieces later, but here I'm just going to cover how I spent my trip (and my money).

## Itinerary

My trip was a sort of out-and-back: I started in Lisbon, worked my way east through Spain, then worked my way south through Italy.
Then I looped *back* to North Italy, and then *back* through Spain, before finishing in Lisbon where I'd begun.

1. Lisbon, Portugal (4 nights)
1. Seville, Spain (2 nights)
1. Granada, Spain (1 night)
1. Madrid, Spain (6 nights)
1. Barcelona, Spain (3 nights)
1. Mallorca, Spain (5 nights)
1. Bergamo, Italy (2 nights)
1. Milan, Italy (1 night)
1. Florence, Italy (3 nights)
1. Rome, Italy (3 nights)
1. Naples, Italy (3 nights)
1. Bergamo, Italy (2 nights)
1. Madrid, Spain (1 night)
1. Seville, Spain (8 nights)
1. Lisbon, Portugal (2 nights)

Visually, it looks like this:

And here I've sorted the cities by where I spent the most total time:

It was 46 nights in total. 26 in Spain, 14 in Italy, and 6 in Portugal.

[^fun]: Fun for me, anyway. Maybe fun for you too, if you like being mad about my opinions.
