A few days ago I got back from Germany, where I was unintentionally continuing my Year of Europe.
This was my third trip to the country but the first time for more than a few days;
I'd visited Berlin for two days in 2013 and Munich for three in 2024.

But this isn't a travel blog.
That would be boring.

No, this is an *interesting* blog, where I post [charts about how much money I spend on food](/feed/2025/03/06/great-sabbatical-2025/#expenses) and tell you [how many times I went running in Spain](/feed/2025/03/06/great-sabbatical-2025/#workouts) and [complain about the coffee in Italy](/feed/2025/03/10/southern-europe-best-and-worst/#coffee).

There isn't as much data to share about this one as [my 7-week Southern Europe Extravaganza](/feed/2025/03/06/great-sabbatical-2025/), but as you know, the whole point of traveling is to talk about it at every opportunity.
Especially on your interesting blog.

## Workouts

I did exactly one workout during my trip: a gingerly jog while feeling sorry for myself.
No need for fancy charts on this one.

It was a very sedentary couple of weeks, because I'd sprained my ankle somewhat seriously a few days before heading to Germany.

## Expenses

Not tracked.
Sorry!

This was cheaper on a per-day basis than most of my past trips because a) I shopped for real groceries and b) much of my time was spent working (remotely) so I didn't have as much leisure time to burn money on activities.

How much cheaper?
Unfortunately I'll never know.
