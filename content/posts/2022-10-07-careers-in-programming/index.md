I recently visited Westville Correctional Facility, an Indiana penitentiary, to talk about jobs in the field of computing.
It was an unusual opportunity that was honestly somewhat eye-opening; never have I had so enthusiastic and engaged an audience.
I was sponsored through the Moreau College Initiative, a program in which residents of the facility are able to take full academic courses and potentially earn a bachelors degree before re-entering society.
You can read more about the program [here](https://www.hcc-nd.edu/moreau-college-initiative/), if you are so interested.

However, I imagine that an introduction to programming careers, assuming no prior knowledge whatsoever, might be useful for others.
