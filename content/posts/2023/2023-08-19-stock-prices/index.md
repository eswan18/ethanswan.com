I can't be the only one who has grappled with the puzzle of stock prices.
Not the price of a specific company, but the more generally mind-bending concept of stocks having prices at all.

You usually buy a stock because you expect to be able to sell it to someone else at some future date.
But why would that person pay you for the stock?
Only because *they*, in turn, think that there's yet another person out there who will buy it from *them*.
So why does anyone think it's valuable to own in the first place?

That's obviously a simplified description of the stock market, but it's not exactly wrong.
Generally, the only material benefit that stock ownership affords[^voting-rights] is dividend payouts, and many companies don't even pay dividends[^dividend-popularity].
It's not immediately clear why stocks have any value at all, and that can make the market feel like a huge, arbitrary bubble.

A common but unsatisfying explanation for stock prices is that stockholders have a claim on the "residual" assets of a company -- what's left over after all the company's obligations (debts, etc.) have been fulfilled.
In real life though, I can't just demand that Apple liquidate its assets, pay off its loans, and hand over my share of the remaining profits simply because I own some stock.

It took me a long time to grapple with this â€“ one that's simple enough to fit in a few paragraphs.

[^voting-rights]: I'm ignoring voting rights, which shareholders are also entitled to in most cases, but I wouldn't consider this a material benefit exactly.
[^dividend-popularity]: I looked for a precise percentage of public companies that don't pay a dividend and found only one result (40%), but it was from 2014. In any case, it's fair to say that dividends are far from a guarantee when investing in stocks.
