I wanted to add some color to a few of my [probability estimates](/feed/2023/12/17/probability-estimates-2024/).
You may want to check those out first if you haven't seen them.

## Business & Tech

### The S&P 500 closes the year higher than it began: 0.72

Dunno.
It usually does, and almost all economic metrics right now seem strong.
On the other hand, consumer sentiment is very negative, and there's much more geopolitical risk right now: trade wars and supply chain disruptions are very plausible.
Overall, I trusted the economic indicators a bit more and am betting that consumer confidence will improve as high inflation fades.

### The Fed raises interest rates at least once in 2024 (even if they also decrease rates): 0.4

I feel like this estimate is well above consensus view, but that consensus view also shifted pretty recently -- from what I can tell -- based on the last few inflation reports.
It seems plausible to me that at some point in the year, due to inflation not falling as much as hoped (or even rising again), the Fed bumps rates.

### Sam Altman is still the CEO of OpenAI at the end of 2024: 0.75

I think he definitively won the power struggle this year.
Still, there's some possibility of him (and the commercial parts of OpenAI) being absorbed into Microsoft proper for some reason, maybe for more capital investment or maybe to escape certain bounds of the charter.
I also think there's a low but not insignificant chance of another effort by AI doomers to unseat him, and they might bring outside powers (e.g. government) into play.

### OpenAI releases (or allows a public preview of) a product branded "GPT-5" or "ChatGPT-5"

I had a hard time with this one.
I believe OpenAI made some statements about holding off on further model development until more safeguards were in place, but with the Sam Altman drama having resolved as a clear victory for the techno-optimists, I think the company is much more likely than not to push ahead.
However, there's a reasonable chance that even if GPT-5 happens, it's under a different name, so this isn't terribly high.

### Business Divestitures (3)
- **Alphabet is ordered to divest a business unit, by federal court or commission: 0.15**
- **Meta is ordered to divest a business unit, by federal court or commission: 0.1**
- **Amazon is ordered to divest a business unit, by federal court or commission: 0.05**

It's generally pretty rare for US courts/commissions to break up existing companies, and I'm betting that they'll be more conservative than some antitrust advocates believe is warranted.

The more interesting thing here is the relative probabalities within the group.
I think that the monopoly power case is much stronger against Google (for search ads) and somewhat stronger against Facebook (some variation on ads) than against Amazon, which competes against many other retailers both physical online.
Whether you think that's the right market definition or not, I think US courts will use it.


### The X/Twitter platform still exists at the end of the year: you can log in, share content, and view content: 0.85

This is a bet that things won't change quite as much as we imagine, even in the most volatile big company on the planet.
Some form of Twitter will be around in a year ... probably.

### Nvidia remains in the top 10 American companies by market cap at the end of 2024: 0.45

I don't think Nvidia's rise is entirely a blip, but it seems like part of it is due to supply constraints and big lead in AI tooling that (I imagine) is going to be copied by other GPU makers.

### Tim Cook is still the CEO of Apple at the end of the year: 0.9

He's 63, older for a tech CEO but not that old. Him announcing some sort of succession plan in 2023 seems plausible if unlikely, but that would still almost certainly be after the release of the Vision Pro (February/March) and would take at least a year.
Beyond that, I can only see him being gone in a year due to a) health problems or b) the tiny possibility of a catastrophic, humiliating flop of the Vision Pro.

### Andy Jassy is still the CEO of Amazon at the end of the year: 0.93

As an outsider, it's not entirely clear how investors see Jassy.
Amazon seems fine but doesn't seem to be growing at the wild rates it did in the 2010s.
I'm out over my skis here though, and I just don't follow enough to have much opinion except that he does have the risk of Bezos wanting to come back at some point.
