Today was my last day at ReviewTrackers.

I'll miss RT.
Over almost two years, I got to experience "startup" life and I transitioned to full time software engineering (after years as a nominal data scientist who happened to do some dev work).
My fellow engineers there were good teachers and listeners, and engineering management was always open to feedback.

I'll be starting a new gig at Capital One on Monday, working on cybersecurity tooling.
Change is usually good but still brings some anxiety.
There will be much to figure out during my first few weeks, but I'm also looking forward to seeing a different engineering culture and tackling new challenges.

Wish me luck!
