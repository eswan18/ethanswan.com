Welcome to the annual content consumption post.
I'll keep it quick.

You can find past years' posts here:
- [2025](/feed/2025/02/07/what-im-reading-feb-2025/)
- [2024](/feed/2024/01/28/what-im-reading-jan-2024/)

Before the full list, here is just the delta:

**Removed**:
- *The Intelligence* from the Economist – good podcast, but I prefer reading my news so I switched to their email newsletter
- *The Morning Briefing* by the New York Times – I was a reader for years, but I don't think its coverage was as principled or thoughtful as I'd want. The Economist has supplanted it.
- *EconTalk* – I still usually listen, but there are more and more episodes I don't find interesting, and I think the host can be out-of-touch in some ways.
- *Cortex* – One of the hosts (my preferred) left the show.

**Added**:
- *The World in Brief* from the Economist – I switched to the Economist newsletters as my primary news source
- *The US in Brief* from the Economist – same as above

## Newsletters

- [Astral Codex Ten](https://www.astralcodexten.com) by Scott Alexander (paid version, but almost all the content is free) – Rationalism, with research and opinions on almost everything important. This continues to be the MVP of my content.
- [Slow Boring](https://www.slowboring.com) by Matt Yglesias (paid version) – Political commentary/analysis. Some hot takes but with empirical backing. Moderate left.
- [Benedict's Newsletter](https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter) by Benedict Evans (free version) – Tech business news and commentary
- [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com) by Ben Thompson (free version) – Tech business commentary
- [Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net) by Nate Silver (paid version) – Commentary on everything. Most isn't worth reading, but when it comes to election forecasting, I think Nate remains clearly the best at it.
- [Python Weekly](https://www.pythonweekly.com) (free) – News and articles relating to Python (the programming language)

## Podcasts

- [Dunc'd On Prime](https://nateduncannba.com) (paid version) – Impossible volumes of deep NBA coverage

- [The Ryen Russillo Show](https://www.barstoolsports.com/shows/7778183/ryen-russillo-podcast/podcasts) – Sports and "life advice", though I usually skip everything but the life advice.
