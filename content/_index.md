I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based technologist and teacher.

My day job is as a developer at <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com">ReviewTrackers</a>, where I work across the full web stack but mostly focus on backend and ML engineering for our NLP applications.

I also teach Python, both freelance and through the University of Cincinnati, where I'm an adjunct instructor.
You can see what I teach [here](/teaching/courses/), and if you or your organization is interested in a class, please reach out.
I offer consulting in ML engineering and web development as well.

Beyond my professional life, I like personal fitness, sports, video games, and occasional tech projects -- some of which I blog about on this site.
As far as tech, I have a particular interest in the design of programming languages and compilers/interpreters.

I tweet infrequently, but you can find me on twitter [@eswan18](https://twitter.com/eswan18).
