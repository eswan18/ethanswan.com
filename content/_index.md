I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based technologist, consultant, and teacher.
I specialize in Python and data systems.

My day job is as a developer at Capital One, where I work across various cybersecurity-enabling services.

I also teach Python and related tech.
You can see what I teach [here](/teaching).
Additionally, I offer consulting services on designing and building complex data systems.

Beyond my professional life, my interests are varied.
Running is something that's been a big part of my life for years, and I have a section of the site devoted to [my thoughts on various running routes](/running-blog).

I also like sports, video games, and occasional tech projects -- all of which pop up occasionally in my regular blog posts.
As far as tech, I have a particular interest in the design of programming languages and compilers/interpreters.

I tweet infrequently, but you can find me on Twitter [@eswan18](https://twitter.com/eswan18).
