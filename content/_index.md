I'm Ethan, a Chicago-based technologist.
I specialize in Python and data systems, especially their use in web applications.

I teach and offer consulting on those topics.
You can see my course offerings [here](/teaching) and my past conference talks [here](/appearances).

Beyond my professional life, my interests are varied.
Running and fitness generally have been a big part of my life for many years, but I also enjoy occasional tech projects -- which pop up occasionally in my [blog posts](/posts).
Within tech, I have a particular interest in the design of programming languages and compilers/interpreters.

I tweet infrequently, but you can find me on Twitter [@eswan18](https://x.com/eswan18).
