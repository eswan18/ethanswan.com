THE Coffee Alley has rapidly become my default option in Chicago, despite its unexpected definite article evoking shades of Buckeye arrogance (all parties involved would do best to just [drop the the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgk2v6KntY)).
It's close to my home and its lattes are slightly above average; what more could you want?
Other than better lattes.

The environment seems like a good place to sit and work, which I hope to test someday.
For now, it fills an important role in my life as the only place within five minutes where I can get a decent latte, and for that it gets a decent rating.
