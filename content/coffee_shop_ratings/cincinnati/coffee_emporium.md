While in most aspects Coffee Emporium is an above average coffee shop, its stunningly bad internet situation is simply too much to overcome.
You are allotted wifi in 45 minute increments (so you don't accidentally use up all the internet?).
And if that isn't irritating enough, the wifi speed is slow enough as to be considered unusable.

There is more I could say about Coffee Emporium, and most of it is positive.
But it doesnâ€™t matter because a place without internet is basically the wilderness.
