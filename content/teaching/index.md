I’ve been teaching Python and related technologies professionally for over five years.
Several of my courses are offered on a regular cadence in partnership with the University of Cincinnati’s Center for Business Analytics.

I also offer private trainings for organizations.
Class sizes are typically about 15, and most courses run between 1 and 2 full days.

Additionally, you can schedule ad hoc time with me. See the [Office Hours page](/office_hours).
