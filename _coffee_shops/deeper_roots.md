Once a subject of my scorn, Deeper Roots has improved the comfort of its seating situation dramatically and vaulted into good coffee shop territory.
It has the reputation for serving some of the best coffee in Cincinnati, though personally it isn't my favorite;
its blends tend to be fruity, and their descriptions read like reviews of fine wine.
It, like Carabello, definitely suffers from a culture of coffee hipsterism that I find very distateful.

Still, it checks the main boxes: good coffee, acceptable seating, and consistent wifi.
Deeper Roots scores as a very average coffee shop (average is okay!).
