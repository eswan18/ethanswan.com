Bean and Barley: ten out of ten.
<br><br>
In every way, this place excels.
Internet speed: excellent. Seating: expansive and comfortable.
Snobbiness: not discernible, but the coffee is still delicious.
Lighting and ambience: truly unparalleled.
Bean and Barley is so far beyond what I even believed was possible in a coffee shop that I waived the standard 3-visit minimum before writing a review.
It's like true love: sometimes you just know.
<br><br>
The single problem with Bean and Barley is that it's so good I don't want to visit other coffee shops.
But for your sake, dear reader, I will persevere;
I must occasionally venture out into the sad world of inferior establishments so I can review them.
