While it isn’t one of the coffee shops that Cincinnati natives typically recommend, Sidewinder is an outstanding cafe.
It’s located in Northside, right next to a now-closed cheese shop.
Talk about prime location!

Sidewinder has pretty decent coffee, a great collection of interesting coffee drinks (some with alcohol), above-average chairs, and generally good ambience but for the occasional noisy crowd.
It would probably score as a solid 6 except for its best feature -- outrageously good wifi.
As a millenial, all I care about is internet speed and avocado toast, and Sidewinder offers at least one of those things (it also serves food, so maybe both at some point!).
As a place to sit and be seriously productive, it’s very hard to beat Sidewinder.
