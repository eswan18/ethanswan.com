This 3-week course covers the fundamentals of interacting with web sites using Python.
Students will learn how to fetch web pages and parse useful information out of HTML code.
To accomplish this, the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) libraries will be covered in some depth, and the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library will be used to wrangle the scraped data.
The course will also introduce the [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) package for interacting with Javascript-oriented sites and the [scrapy](https://scrapy.org) package for recursively crawling multiple web pages.
