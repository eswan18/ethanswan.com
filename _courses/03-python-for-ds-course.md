This is a 7-week, 2-credit hour course focused on using Python for data science.
Topics include data wrangling, interaction with data sources, visualization, running scripts, the Python ecosystem, functions, and modeling.

###### Objectives
1. Expose students to the Python data science ecosystem's libraries, capabilities, and vocabulary.
2. Build students' proficiency in the core data wrangling skills: importing data, reshaping data, transforming data, and exporting data.
3. Develop students' ability to use Python within both interactive (Jupyter, REPL) and non-interactive (scripts) environments.
4. Explore various methods of producing output in Python: plotting, exporting various data formats, converting notebooks to static files as deliverables, and writing to a SQL database.
5. Expose students to modeling via scikit-learn and discuss the fundamentals of building models in Python.
6. Teach students how and when to teach themselves, through a discussion of widely-available Python resources.
