This course is an introduction to Python and its uses as a data analytics tool, requiring no previous Python experience.
It begins with the core concepts of Python itself: data types, functions, and objects.
With that foundational knowledge, students will be introduced to the core tools in Python’s data science toolkit: the `pandas` package for data wrangling and the `seaborn` package for visualization.
Students will spend some of their time working through a case study, in which they can apply the concepts they’ve learned while instructors are available to help with questions.
