This workshop builds on concepts taught in the introductory course (i.e. the basics of Python and its data science stack).
Students will learn how to integrate control flow into their code, write their own reusable functions, and build a variety of models using the cutting-edge scikit-learn library.
They will also get more exposure to practical concerns of using Python in a reliable and scalable way: how to manage multiple Python environments using conda, what other packages exist in the data science ecosystem, and the basics of running Python from the command line.
