This is a two-day course that introduces how one can use Python for advanced machine learning applications.
Most of the time will be spent working through example problems end-to-end in the classroom.
Students will learn the fundamentals of the *scikit-learn* library along with exploring several other tools and methodologies that allow you to implement a robust end-to-end machine learning workflow.
Some additional time will be reserved for discussion of real programming challenges students have encountered, and for an overview of related relevant technologies students may need in an industry setting (e.g. Git and GitHub).
