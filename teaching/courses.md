I've been teaching Python and related technologies professionally for over five years.
Several of my courses are offered on a regular cadence in partnership with the University of Cincinnati's [Center for Business Analytics](https://business.uc.edu/centers-partnerships/business-analytics.html).
Where applicable, the upcoming sessions and signups links for those workshops are included below.

I also offer private trainings for organizations.
Class sizes are typically about 15, and most courses run between 1 and 2 full days.
For details, including rates, please contact me by email: [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com)

Additionally, you can schedule ad hoc time with me.
See the [Office Hours](/teaching/office_hours) page.
