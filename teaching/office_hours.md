title: Office Hours
---

I offer private office hours for issues related to software development and data science.
My primary expertise is Python and its ecosystem, but I can also help with Git, CI/CD systems, and some other related technologies.
These sessions are held over video call, and you may bring specific questions (including code that you need help with) or general topics youâ€™d like me to explain and discuss.

My rate is $100 an hour, billed in 30-minute chunks.
For new clients, the first 30 minutes are free.
You decide whether the help is valuable enough to continue.

To schedule a session, contact me by email: [ethanpswan@gmail.com](mailto:ethanpswan@gmail.com)
